## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
Marvel Universe is minimized in my pets
This is my first application with Jetpack Compose! I'm so excited to try it
#AndroidDevChallenge

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
For the app, I would like to build an app to track the logs of my pets such as:
+ Inject Vaccine
+ Log sick date
+ Funny things
+ Stories

For Jetpack Compose, I would like to try a new technique with Kotlin. Making UI Code with Kotlin is an excellent idea and I can code everything with Kotlin.
When I finished the app, I understand why Jetpack Compose was born
